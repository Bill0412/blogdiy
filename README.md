# Blog DIY Project
Most of the demos here is likely to become a feature of my project <https://blogdiy.net>, which is a blog startup guidance for Chinese users.

## Feature 1: Deploy WordPress to a Remote Server
1. Given the **host**, **port**, **username** and **password** of a remote server, the server creates a thread and deploy the latest WordPress Docker to a remote server and the WordPress container listens at port 80.

### Todos
1. - [ ] Integrate proper PHP code into the WordPress template on <https://blogdiy.net/> so that it sends the incrypted info to this server.
2. - [ ] When this server receives the instructions (currently only deploy WordPress Docker) from <https://blogdiy.net/>, it should deploy the docker to the target remote server.

## Feature 2: More templates like Hexo support
Waiting for the client feedback of the first feature to continue.

## More Features
Under development.
