# Blog DIY Project
Most of the demos here is likely to become a feature of my project <https://blogdiy.net>, which is a blog startup guidance for Chinese users.

## Feature 1: Deploy WordPress to a Remote Server
1. Given the **host**, **port**, **username** and **password** of a remote server, the server creates a thread and deploy the latest WordPress Docker to a remote server and the WordPress container listens at port 80.

### Todos
1. - [x] Send the target server information to the server that is in charge of deployment
2. - [ ] When this server receives the instructions (currently only deploy WordPress Docker) from <https://blogdiy.net/>, it should deploy the docker to the target remote server. A bash script should be implemented. Using git clone and executing the script to deploy.

## Feature 2: More templates like Hexo support
Waiting for the client feedback of the first feature to continue.
